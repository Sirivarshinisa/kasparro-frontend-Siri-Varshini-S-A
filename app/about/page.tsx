            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We believe the future of search is conversational, powered by AI models that understand 
              context and synthesize information. Traditional SEO was built for algorithms that rank 
              pages. Kasparro is built for AI systems that answer questions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Our mission is to give brands the tools and insights they need to thrive in this new era where 
              visibility isn't about ranking #1 on Google, but about being the trusted source AI models cite.

                  We don't take old SEO metrics and slap "AI" on them. Every module, signal, and 
                  recommendation is designed specifically for how AI models consume and trust information.

                  AI-SEO is inherently complex, but our product shouldn't be. We distill sophisticated 
                  analysis into clear scores, prioritized issues, and actionable recommendations.

                  We don't dump dashboards full of metrics. Every data point exists to inform a decision. 
                  Every recommendation includes expected impact and effort estimates.

                  Search is shifting from Google to ChatGPT, Perplexity, and platforms we haven't seen yet. 
                  Kasparro is architected to evolve with the AI search landscape, not chase short-term hacks.

            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              In five years, the majority of online queries won't happen in a search engine. They'll happen 
              in AI assistants, chatbots, and intelligent agents that synthesize answers from trusted sources.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Brands that understand this shift—and optimize for entity recognition, trust signals, and 
              AI reasoning patterns—will dominate their categories. Those that stick to traditional SEO 
              playbooks will become invisible.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Kasparro exists to be the definitive platform for brands navigating this transition. 
              We're not just tracking AI-SEO metrics; we're defining what AI-SEO means.

                  Kasparro analyzes how Large Language Models (LLMs) process and prioritize information 
                  during response generation. We study attention mechanisms, retrieval-augmented generation

                  source selection, and factual grounding—going beyond traditional PageRank-style metrics to 
                  evaluate semantic relevance, entity salience, and trustworthiness indicators.

                  relation extraction, semantic similarity models, and sentiment analysis to understand how 
                  brand content is structured, linked, and potentially interpreted by AI systems.

                  Every audit builds a custom knowledge graph mapping relationships between your brand, 
                  products, competitors, industry concepts, and authoritative sources. This graph mirrors 
                  how AI models construct internal representations and helps identify gaps in entity coverage 
                  and relationship clarity.

                  We continuously query AI search engines with relevant prompts, analyzing response patterns, 
                  citation frequencies, competitive positioning, and content attribution. This provides 
                  empirical data about how AI models actually behave, not just theoretical optimization guidelines.
